poor attempt at a ~~(minecraft clone)~~ multiplayer voxel engine (engine?) yeah engine that sounds smart

### Urmm, how do i build?!?!
~~for now, you dont, just admire the code and use your imagination :)~~  
on windows run `client_build.bat`  
on linux run `client_build.sh`  
pray in both cases  
you most likely need to install glfw, cglm (scoop or yay i guess)  
on windows u gotta do some hacky ass shit ill doc it l8r B)  
SERVER ONLY WORKS IN WINDOWS FOR NOW  
UNTIL I WRITE THE SAME CODE TWICE!!!
